# Distributed File System

## Introduction

This project is a distributed file system that is implemented using the Go programming language. The system is designed to be fault-tolerant and scalable. The system is implemented using many algorithm to ensure that the system is fault-tolerant. The system is also designed to be scalable by allowing the system to add new nodes to the system. The system is also designed to be efficient by using a distributed hash table to store the files in the system.

## Features

- Fault-tolerant
- Scalable
- Efficient
- Distributed Hash Table
- Add new nodes to the system
- Remove nodes from the system
- List all files in the system
- Upload files to the system
- Download files from the system
- Delete files from the system
- Replicate files in the system

## Installation

To install the system, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download Go from the official website. Once you have Go installed, you can clone the repository and run the following command to install the system:

```bash
go install
```

## Usage

To use the system, you need to run the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```
